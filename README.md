FASTAPI DOCKERIZED APPLICATION

This project is a Dockerized FastAPI application with a simple API for managing user data. User data is stored in a JSON file, allowing for lightweight, persistent storage without a database. Docker and Docker Compose make it easy to deploy and manage, ensuring consistency across environments. FastAPIâ€™s built-in Swagger UI provides interactive documentation, making it easy to test and explore the API endpoints. This setup is ideal for learning FastAPI basics, containerization with Docker, and data persistence using Docker volumes.
